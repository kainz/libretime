# libretime_watch
#
... is started by a init.d script (should be init later)
... is watching for files in a watching directory ;-)
... is kicked off by a cronjob test_rabbit.py (should be done by libretime later)
... is doing an analyse of the media file (ID3 tag, cue in, cue out, rgain, ...)
... is doing an insert or update in the database (should be done by libretime later)

It will not create a new db entry for existing files, just updating it !!!!

Most of the stuff has been inspired by the airtime programs media-monitor and 
airtime_analyze
